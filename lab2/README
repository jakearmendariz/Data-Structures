In lab2 I created the FileReverse.c program which intakes strings from the "in" file. It
then outputs the words in reversed form on different lines to the "out" file. If the
input contains a word that is larger than 256 chars the program will crash. The make
file creates an executable binary file called FileReverse and includes a clean utulity.
