Lab3

a. When struct_test.c is run multiple times the addresses change

b. For the original rider_st 12 bytes of memory are allocated.

c. For the extended rider_st 20 bytes of memory are allocated, 4 bytes for each additional int value.

lab3 contains two c programs. struct_test.c is just a program practicing proper use of structures, with and
without pointers. charType.c takes two command line arguments, input, output file. It will ouput the contents
of the input file to the output file seperating each line out and numbering each type of character. The 
Makefile compiles charType.c and removes charType.o. It also has a valgrind target.  Thank you!

PS: I left in the input and output file but I am not sure if I was suppose to, sorry for the inconvience if it is one.
