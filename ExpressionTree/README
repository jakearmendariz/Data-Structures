This project is very late because I got a concussion. Proffessor Bhatti knows.

Description:
Lab5 makes expression trees using postfix notation. It creates a tree and then it will write it out
in nornmal algebraic notations. It will produce a result once finished. The program requires 3 soource files:
stack.c, ExpTree.c and ExpTreeClient.c header files: ExpTree Stack.h with a Makefile 
that will create an executable called PostFixCalculator to run all of it.
