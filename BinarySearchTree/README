Description
In this assignment there is 2 header files:BST.h defining methods for a BST and BSTUI.h which contains many constants
for the program, 2 source files BST and BSTClient.c which controls he user interface and one makefile
The makefile creates an executable BST. When you run this it will create a simple UI that you can use to create
edit and delete a BST and all of it's elements. It handles all errors of input and is pretty self explanatory.
With the "help" command one can see all of the possible commands. The input for each node is limited to a 150
string. If it goes over the program handles it on it's own. The BST.h holds all modifyers. 
BST.c implements them. BSTUTI.h has all of the constants and prompts to make it easier to read the BSTClient.c 
All incorrect input is handeled within BSTClient.c so that no input will cause an exepected ending of the program :)
Different to previoous version in assignment three, this one contains a function to delete individual nodes.
Thanks!
