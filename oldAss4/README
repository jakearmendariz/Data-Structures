Assignment 3
I decided to turn in this file late because I was worried that my program wouldn't be able to take input from a textfile
However I learned that Unix handles that for me so that was mostly a waste. I did fix my input length method so maybe it was worth the late submission
Either way thank you.

In this assignment there is 2 header files, 2 source files and one makefile
The makefile creates an executable BST. When you run this it will create a simple Ui that you can use to create
edit and delete a BST and all of it's elements. It handles all errors of input and is pretty self explanatory.
With the "help" command one can see all of the possible commands. The input for each node is limited to a 150
string. If it goes over the program handles it on it's own. The BST.h holds all modifyers. 
BST.c implements them. BSTUTI.h has all of the constants and prompts to make it easier to read the BSTClient.c 
All incorrect input is handeled within BSTClient.c so that no input will cause an exepected ending of the program :)
Thanks!
